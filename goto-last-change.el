;;; Commentary:

;; After installing goto-last-change.el in a `load-path' directory and
;; compiling it with `M-x byte-compile-file', load it with
;;      (require 'goto-last-change)
;; or autoload it with
;;      (autoload 'goto-last-change "goto-last-change"
;;        "Set point to the position of the last change." t)
;;
;; You may also want to bind a key to `M-x goto-last-change', e.g.
;;      (global-set-key "\C-x\C-\\" 'goto-last-change)

;; goto-last-change.el was written in response to the following:
;;
;; From: Dan Jacobson <jidanni@jidanni.org>
;; Newsgroups: gnu.emacs.bug
;; Subject: function to go to spot of last change
;; Date: Sun, 15 Jun 2003 00:15:08 +0000 (UTC)
;; Sender: news <news@main.gmane.org>
;; Message-ID: <mailman.7910.1055637181.21513.bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org>
;; NNTP-Posting-Host: monty-python.gnu.org
;;
;;
;; Why of course, a function to get the user to the spot of last changes
;; in the current buffer(s?), that's what emacs must lack.
;;
;; How many times have you found yourself mosying [<-not in spell
;; checker!?] thru a file when you wonder, where the heck was I just
;; editing?  Well, the best you can do is hit undo, ^F, and undo again,
;; to get back.  Hence the "burning need" for the additional function,
;; which you might name the-jacobson-memorial-function, due to its brilliance.
